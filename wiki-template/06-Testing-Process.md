# Testing Process

## Overview

The testing process outlined here provides an overview of the strategies, tools, and procedures employed to ensure the quality and reliability of the software. This document covers the types of testing performed, the management of test cases, the process for bug tracking and reporting, the tools and frameworks used for automated testing, and the integration of testing into the CI/CD pipeline.

{Questions to ask the development team: 
- What is the overarching strategy for testing (e.g., Test-Driven Development, Behavior-Driven Development)?
- How does the testing process align with the overall project lifecycle?}

## Testing Types

The project utilises various types of testing to ensure comprehensive coverage and reliability of the software. The main types of testing include:

- **Unit Testing**: {Description of how unit tests are written, executed, and what tools are used.}
  
- **Integration Testing**: {Explanation of how integration tests are set up and which components are tested together.}
  
- **Regression Testing**: {Details on when and how regression tests are performed to ensure new code changes do not break existing functionality.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- What are the specific tools used for each type of testing (e.g., JUnit for unit testing)?
- How frequently are each of these tests run, and at what stages of development?
- Are there any other types of testing performed that should be documented?}

## Test Case Management

Test cases are critical to ensuring that the software meets its requirements and functions as expected. The following practices are followed for managing test cases:

- **Creation**: {How are test cases created? Is there a specific format or template used?}
  
- **Review**: {Describe the review process for test cases, including who is responsible and how often reviews occur.}
  
- **Updates**: {How are test cases updated in response to changes in the software or testing requirements?}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- Which tool or platform is used for managing test cases (e.g., TestRail, Jira)?
- What guidelines or standards are followed for writing and reviewing test cases?
- How are test cases prioritised and who is responsible for maintaining them?}

## Bug Tracking and Reporting

Bugs are tracked and reported systematically to ensure they are resolved promptly and do not reoccur. The bug tracking process includes:

- **Tool Used**: {Identify the tool used for bug tracking, such as Jira or GitHub Issues.}
  
- **Reporting Process**: {Describe the process for reporting bugs, including who is responsible and what information is required.}
  
- **Prioritisation**: {How are bugs prioritised and who decides which bugs are addressed first?}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- What is the standard format or template for reporting bugs?
- How are bugs assigned and who is responsible for tracking their resolution?
- Are there any special procedures for critical or high-priority bugs?}

## Automated Testing Tools and Frameworks

Automated testing is an essential part of the development process, ensuring that tests are repeatable and can be run frequently. The tools and frameworks used include:

- **Tools**: {List the tools and frameworks used for automated testing (e.g., Selenium, Cypress, JUnit).}
  
- **Integration**: {How are automated tests integrated into the development process? Are there any specific guidelines for writing automated tests?}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- Which tools are used for different types of automated testing?
- How are automated tests integrated into the CI/CD pipeline?
- Are there any best practices or guidelines followed when writing automated tests?}

## CI/CD Pipeline Integration

Testing is integrated into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure that code changes are validated before deployment. The integration includes:

- **Stages**: {Which stages of the pipeline include testing, and what types of tests are run at each stage?}
  
- **Monitoring**: {How is the testing process monitored and managed within the CI/CD pipeline?}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- How are testing stages configured in the CI/CD pipeline?
- What tools or dashboards are used to monitor the results of tests in the pipeline?
- Are there any specific configurations or scripts used to manage testing within the CI/CD pipeline?}
