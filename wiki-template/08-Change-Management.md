# Change Management

## Overview

The Change Management process outlines how changes to the project are requested, evaluated, approved, communicated, and documented. This ensures that all changes are implemented in a controlled manner, minimising risk and ensuring alignment with project goals.

{Questions to ask the development team:
- What is the overall approach or framework guiding change management in the project (e.g., ITIL, Agile)?
- Are there any specific guidelines or principles that the team follows when managing changes?}

## Change Request Process

The change request process is the first step in managing changes to the project. It includes:

- **Submission**: {Describe how change requests are submitted, including who can submit them and what information must be included.}
  
- **Categorisation and Prioritisation**: {Explain how change requests are categorised (e.g., minor, major, emergency) and the criteria used for prioritisation.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- Who is allowed to submit a change request?
- What are the required elements of a change request (e.g., description, justification, impact)?
- What tool or platform is used to manage and track change requests?
- How are change requests categorised and prioritised?}

## Impact Analysis and Risk Assessment

Before a change is approved, an impact analysis and risk assessment are conducted:

- **Impact Analysis**: {Detail the process for assessing the impact of a change, including the factors considered and who is responsible.}
  
- **Risk Assessment**: {Describe how the risk associated with a change is evaluated, including the criteria for determining risk levels and the steps for mitigating risks.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- Who conducts the impact analysis, and what factors are considered?
- Are there specific tools or templates used for impact analysis?
- How is the risk of a change assessed, and what criteria are used to determine risk levels?
- What steps are taken to mitigate risks identified during the assessment?}

## Approval Workflow for Changes

Changes must go through an approval process before implementation:

- **Approval Authorities**: {Identify who needs to approve changes and the workflow for different types of changes (e.g., minor vs. major changes).}
  
- **Documentation of Approvals**: {Explain how the approval or rejection of changes is documented and communicated.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- Who is responsible for approving changes?
- Is there a different approval process for minor vs. major changes?
- How is the decision to approve or reject a change documented?
- Is there a formal review process or meeting for approving changes?}

## Communication Plan for Changes

Once a change is approved, it must be communicated to all relevant stakeholders:

- **Communication Channels**: {List the channels or tools used to communicate changes, such as email, meetings, or project management tools.}
  
- **Feedback Collection**: {Describe how feedback on proposed changes is collected and incorporated into the process.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- Who is responsible for communicating changes to the team and stakeholders?
- What tools or channels are used for communication?
- How is feedback on changes collected and managed?
- Is there a formal communication plan or schedule for announcing changes?}

## Change Tracking and Documentation

All changes must be tracked and documented throughout the project:

- **Tracking**: {Explain the tools or systems used to track changes, and how progress is monitored.}
  
- **Documentation**: {Describe the required documentation for each change, including templates or formats used.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- What tools or systems are used to track changes (e.g., Jira, Confluence, Git)?
- How is the progress of changes monitored and reported?
- Is there a standard format or template for documenting changes?
- How are changes documented in the project repository or other official documentation?}
