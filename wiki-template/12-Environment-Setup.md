# Environment Setup

## Overview

This section provides detailed instructions on setting up the development and testing environments. It covers the local development setup, details about the development, staging, and production environments, access credentials, database setup, and common troubleshooting tips.

{Questions to ask the development team:
- Are there any overall guidelines or principles that should be followed when setting up the environment?
- Is there a specific order in which the environments should be set up or configured?}

## Local Development Setup Guide

To set up the local development environment, follow these steps:

- **IDE Configuration**: {List the recommended IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA) and any specific configuration settings needed.}
  
- **Dependencies**: {Identify the dependencies that need to be installed, such as libraries, frameworks, and tools. Include installation instructions.}
  
- **Configuration Files**: {Describe any configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `settings.json`) that need to be created or modified for local development.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- Which IDEs are recommended for this project?
- What dependencies must be installed for local development, and how are they installed?
- Are there specific configuration settings or files that developers need to set up?}

## Development, Staging, and Production Environment Details

The project environments are set up as follows:

- **Development Environment**: {Describe the development environment setup, including the purpose, typical configurations, and any special considerations.}
  
- **Staging Environment**: {Provide details about the staging environment, such as how it mirrors production, and how it is used for testing before deployment.}
  
- **Production Environment**: {Outline the production environment setup, including key configurations, security considerations, and deployment processes.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- What are the key differences between the development, staging, and production environments?
- How are these environments configured, and what tools or platforms are used (e.g., AWS, Docker)?
- Are there any specific setup instructions or scripts for each environment?}

## Access Credentials and Permissions

Access to the project environments requires the following credentials and permissions:

- **Credentials**: {List the credentials required to access each environment (e.g., SSH keys, API tokens).}
  
- **Permissions**: {Describe the roles and permissions assigned to different team members, and how access is managed.}
  
- **Access Requests**: {Explain the process for requesting access to the environments, including who to contact and any approval steps required.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- What credentials are required to access the different environments, and how are they obtained?
- How are roles and permissions managed within the project?
- What is the process for team members to request access to the environments?}

## Database Setup and Migration Steps

The following steps are required to set up the database and perform migrations:

- **Database Installation**: {Provide instructions for installing the necessary database software (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).}
  
- **Initial Setup**: {Describe how to set up the database schema, including any scripts or tools that should be used.}
  
- **Migrations**: {Outline the process for applying database migrations, including how to manage version control for the database schema.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- Which database system is used, and how should it be installed locally?
- What are the steps for setting up the initial database schema?
- How are database migrations managed, and what tools are used?}

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues that may arise during environment setup and how to resolve them:

- **Issue 1**: {Describe a common issue and its resolution.}
  
- **Issue 2**: {Describe another common issue and its resolution.}
  
- **Logs and Debugging**: {Provide tips for using logs and debugging tools to identify and fix issues during setup.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- What are the most common issues developers encounter during environment setup?
- How can these issues be resolved, and are there specific tools or logs that can help?
- Are there any troubleshooting resources or documentation available?}
