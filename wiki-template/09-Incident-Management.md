# Incident Management

## Overview

The Incident Management process is designed to ensure that incidents are managed and resolved efficiently, minimising impact on the project and its stakeholders. This section outlines the process for reporting incidents, roles and responsibilities during an incident, resolution steps and timelines, post-incident review, and communication protocols.

{Questions to ask the development team:
- Are there any specific guidelines or principles that the team follows when managing incidents?
- Is there a particular framework or methodology (e.g., ITIL, Agile) that guides incident management?}

## Incident Reporting Process

Incidents are reported through the following process:

- **Reporting Channels**: {Describe who can report an incident and how incidents are reported.}
  
- **Required Information**: {List the information that must be included in an incident report, such as the nature of the incident, affected systems, and severity.}
  
- **Tools and Platforms**: {Identify any tools or platforms used for reporting and tracking incidents, such as Jira, ServiceNow, or internal systems.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- Who is authorised to report an incident?
- What specific details should be included in an incident report?
- What tools or systems are used for tracking incidents?}

## Roles and Responsibilities During an Incident

The following roles and responsibilities are defined during an incident:

- **Incident Manager**: {Identify who is responsible for overseeing the incident management process, including coordinating response efforts and making critical decisions.}
  
- **Technical Team**: {Describe the role of the technical team in diagnosing and resolving the incident.}
  
- **Communication Lead**: {Identify who is responsible for communicating updates to stakeholders and ensuring that the communication protocol is followed.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- Who takes on the role of Incident Manager during an incident?
- What are the specific responsibilities of each team member during an incident?
- Is there a designated person responsible for communication during incidents?}

## Incident Resolution Steps and Timelines

The steps to resolve an incident and the expected timelines are as follows:

- **Initial Assessment**: {Describe the process for conducting an initial assessment of the incident, including how quickly this must be done after the incident is reported.}
  
- **Diagnosis and Resolution**: {Outline the steps involved in diagnosing the issue and implementing a resolution.}
  
- **Timelines**: {Provide expected timelines for each step, including any SLAs (Service Level Agreements) that must be adhered to.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- What are the typical steps taken to resolve an incident?
- Are there any timelines or SLAs that must be followed?
- How is the progress of incident resolution tracked and communicated?}

## Post-Incident Review and Documentation

After an incident is resolved, a post-incident review is conducted:

- **Review Process**: {Describe the process for reviewing the incident, including who is involved and what aspects are evaluated.}
  
- **Documentation**: {Identify what documentation must be created following an incident, such as incident reports, lessons learned, and action items.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- Who is responsible for conducting the post-incident review?
- What should be documented after an incident, and where is this documentation stored?
- Are there specific lessons learned or action items tracked after each incident?}

## Communication Protocol During Incidents

Clear communication is critical during an incident. The communication protocol includes:

- **Communication Channels**: {List the channels used to communicate during an incident, such as Slack, email, or dedicated incident response tools.}
  
- **Frequency of Updates**: {Describe how often updates are communicated to stakeholders and the team during an incident.}
  
- **Stakeholder Communication**: {Identify who is responsible for communicating with stakeholders and what information should be shared.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- What channels are used to communicate during an incident?
- How frequently are updates provided to the team and stakeholders?
- Who is responsible for ensuring that communication is clear and consistent during an incident?}
