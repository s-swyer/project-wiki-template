# Release Management

## Overview

The Release Management process ensures that software is deployed into production in a controlled, reliable, and efficient manner. This section details the release schedule, approval process, deployment checklist, rollback procedures, post-release monitoring, and the tools used for deployment.

{Questions to ask the development team:
- What is the overall strategy or philosophy behind the release process?
- Is there a specific methodology (e.g., Continuous Delivery) that guides how releases are handled?}

## Release Schedule and Cadence

Releases are scheduled according to the following guidelines:

- **Release Frequency**: {Describe the regular release cadence, such as weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly.}
- **Types of Releases**: {Explain the different types of releases, such as major, minor, and hotfixes, and how they are scheduled.}
- **Release Planning**: {How are release dates planned and adjusted? Is there a formal release calendar?}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- How often are releases planned?
- Are there specific criteria that determine when and how different types of releases are scheduled?
- Who is responsible for planning and adjusting release dates?}

## Release Approval Process

Before a release can be deployed, it must go through an approval process that includes the following steps:

- **Approval Authorities**: {Identify the individuals or roles who must approve a release before deployment.}
- **Approval Criteria**: {Describe the criteria that must be met for a release to be approved, such as testing completion, code reviews, and stakeholder sign-off.}
- **Review Process**: {Outline the review process that occurs before approval, including any meetings, documentation, or checklists.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- Who needs to approve a release?
- What specific criteria must be met for a release to be approved?
- Is there a formal review process, and what does it entail?}

## Deployment Checklist

The deployment checklist ensures that all necessary steps are completed before deploying a release. The checklist typically includes:

- **Pre-Deployment Tasks**: {List the tasks that must be completed before deployment, such as final testing, code reviews, and documentation updates.}
- **Responsible Parties**: {Identify who is responsible for completing each task on the checklist.}
- **Checklist Template**: {Is there a standard template or format for the deployment checklist?}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- What tasks must be completed before a release can be deployed?
- Who is responsible for ensuring that each task is completed?
- Is there a standardised deployment checklist that is used?}

## Rollback Procedures

In the event that a release needs to be rolled back, the following procedures are followed:

- **Rollback Triggers**: {Describe the situations or criteria that would trigger a rollback.}
- **Rollback Steps**: {Outline the specific steps or scripts used to perform a rollback.}
- **Data Handling**: {Explain how data is managed during a rollback, especially if there are database changes.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- What triggers a rollback, and who decides when to initiate it?
- Are there specific steps or scripts used for rolling back a release?
- How is data handled during a rollback, particularly if database changes are involved?}

## Post-Release Monitoring and Validation

After a release is deployed, it is monitored and validated to ensure its success. The process includes:

- **Monitoring Tools**: {List the tools and metrics used to monitor the release after deployment.}
- **Validation Process**: {Describe how the release is validated post-deployment to confirm its success.}
- **Issue Resolution**: {Outline the process for addressing any issues that arise after the release.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- What tools and metrics are used for post-release monitoring?
- Who is responsible for validating the release after deployment?
- What actions are taken if issues are identified during post-release monitoring?}

## Tools Used for Deployment

The following tools are used to manage and deploy releases:

- **Deployment Tools**: {List the tools and platforms used for deployment, such as Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes.}
- **Integration with Release Process**: {Explain how these tools are integrated into the release process and any automation involved.}

{Questions to ask the development team:
- What tools are used for deploying releases?
- How are these tools integrated into the release process?
- Are there any automation scripts or processes that assist with deployment?}
